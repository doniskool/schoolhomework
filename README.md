This is the code for the homework and the output the code will also be in .py 

k = "Donavon malave"
summer = "during summer of 2024"
l = "lucky"
g = 3.3


print(f"hello my name is {k} I am currently a junior."), print(f"So far I will admit I have not learned much as I did use a little bit of c+ {summer} I was not able to make anything advancd but I have made a calculator using python and c+ so far, variables do work a little differently in python I have noticed that the var commands do not act the same. Using print is the simplest part of coding so Im not really confused on anything like that I am trying to currently figure out the float command as it's one of the more simple commands that I have not yet fully understood I do have a pet named {l} he is a dog and has helped with me coding unironically, as sometimes he would make it less stressful to code and I could just pet him to relieve stress since coding is sometimes annoying. This does not mean I don't want to learn to code better I feel like I could definetly become better at coding and better at doing work in general as I currently only have a gpa of {g} and that is quite saddening to me."), print("Overall this is quite saddening to me as I feel like I could do better but at the same time I feel somewhat bored in class due to me having more knowledge than others to an extent."), print(input("does this pass the homework requirements? (yes, no)"))

this is the output.

hello my name is Donavon malave I am currently a junior.
So far I will admit I have not learned much as I did use a little bit of c+ during summer of 2024 I was not able to make anything advancd but I have made a calculator using python and c+ so far, variables do work a little differently in python I have noticed that the var commands do not act the same. Using print is the simplest part of coding so Im not really confused on anything like that I am trying to currently figure out the float command as it's one of the more simple commands that I have not yet fully understood I do have a pet named lucky he is a dog and has helped with me coding unironically, as sometimes he would make it less stressful to code and I could just pet him to relieve stress since coding is sometimes annoying. This does not mean I don't want to learn to code better I feel like I could definetly become better at coding and better at doing work in general as I currently only have a gpa of 3.3 and that is quite saddening to me.
Overall this is quite saddening to me as I feel like I could do better but at the same time I feel somewhat bored in class due to me having more knowledge than others to an extent.
does this pass the homework requirements? (yes, no)
