# I do not know If I followed requirements exactly.
print(f"hello my name is {k} I am currently a junior."), print(f"So far I will admit I have not learned much as I did use a little bit of c+ {summer} I was not able to make anything advancd but I have made a calculator using python and c+ so far, variables do work a little differently in python I have noticed that the var commands do not act the same. Using print is the simplest part of coding so Im not really confused on anything like that I am trying to currently figure out the float command as it's one of the more simple commands that I have not yet fully understood I do have a pet named {l} he is a dog and has helped with me coding unironically, as sometimes he would make it less stressful to code and I could just pet him to relieve stress since coding is sometimes annoying. This does not mean I don't want to learn to code better I feel like I could definetly become better at coding and better at doing work in general as I currently only have a gpa of {g} and that is quite saddening to me."), print("Overall this is quite saddening to me as I feel like I could do better but at the same time I feel somewhat bored in class due to me having more knowledge than others to an extent."), print(input("does this pass the homework requirements? (yes, no)"))
